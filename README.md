# Dynamic Clock

This is a simple HTML and JavaScript code for creating a dynamic clock with the ability to toggle between light and dark modes.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the clock and includes links to the necessary styles and scripts.

- **style.css**: The stylesheet file that defines the appearance of the clock and handles the dark mode styles.

- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for updating the clock in real-time and toggling between light and dark modes.

## Dependencies

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (version 5.15.4): External CSS library for including icon fonts. The clock includes moon and sun icons for dark and light modes, respectively.

## How It Works

The JavaScript code uses the `setInterval` function to update the clock every second. It retrieves the current time, formats it, and updates the corresponding HTML elements to display the hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM indicator. Additionally, the dark mode toggle is implemented to switch between light and dark styles.
